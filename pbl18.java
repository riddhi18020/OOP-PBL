/*Write a Java program to create an abstract class Vehicle with:
● An abstract method fuelType() that returns the type of fuel used.
● An abstract method noOfWheels() that returns the number of wheels.
Create two subclasses:
● Car that uses Petrol/Diesel and has 4 wheels.
● Bike that uses Petrol and has 2 wheels.
In the main method, create objects of Car and Bike, and display their fuel type and number of

wheels. */
